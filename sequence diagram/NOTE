NOTE: All the synchronous calls are asynchronous in the implementation. 
In addition to “boundary”, “entity”, “control”, I have marked the classes as “dao” (the main aim of these classes is to retrieve information from the persistency layer)
and “engineering” (these classes are introduced as an additional help to the control class). 
“boundary” classes cannot communicate with “entity” classes. In this case I used the “entity” mark also for the bean classes. 
Boundary and Bean classes can communicate with each other.
The destroys are not implemented since the deallocation in Java is in charge of the Garbage Collector.
